Liara wakes up in the tent next to marcus and sera and says good morning

Liara stretched, a yawn escaping her lips. "Good morning," she mumbled, her voice raspy. 

Marcus didn't move, his eyes still fixed on the map spread across the rough-hewn table. He didn't acknowledge her greeting.

Sera, however, sat up abruptly, her hand hovering near the pouch of herbs at her hip. "What's that you mumbled?" she asked, her voice sharp. 




Liara studies Marcus' face, looking for signs of his emotions.

Liara frowned, studying Marcus's impassive features. "I said good morning," she repeated, her voice louder this time. 

Marcus finally glanced at her, his gaze cold and assessing. "We have matters to discuss," he said gruffly, pointing to the map with a calloused finger. 

Sera snorted. "Matters like how to deal with the fact that we're about to be overrun by monsters, I imagine."
