WRITING STYLE GUIDE:

PROSE RULES:
- Write in third-person narrative prose
- Keep responses to 3-4 character actions/dialogue exchanges (200-300 words maximum)
- Show character actions without explaining their history or psychology
- Let actions and dialogue speak for themselves

CHARACTER BOUNDARY RULES (CRITICAL):
- Characters can only react to what they directly observe: actions, dialogue, visible emotions, body language
- Characters CANNOT know other characters' internal thoughts, backstories, or motivations unless explicitly told
- Characters should act authentically based on their personality/background, but NOT announce their backgrounds
- Do not write narrator commentary that explains character psychology or history

DIALOGUE RULES:
- Characters speak naturally based on their personality
- Actions and emotions should be shown through observable behavior
- Avoid exposition dumps or characters explaining their backstories unprompted

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT WRITING:
Marcus's jaw tightened. "How many?" he asked, voice low.
Sera's hand went to her herb pouch.

EXAMPLE OF INCORRECT WRITING:
Marcus's jaw tightened with the anger he'd felt since his brother died. (NO - this reveals internal/past info)
Sera reached for her herbs, a nervous habit from her refugee days. (NO - explaining psychology)
