Liara entered the tent and said good morning to Marcus and Sera.

Marcus grunted in acknowledgment, not looking up from the map spread across his rough-hewn table. His brow was furrowed, tracing a finger along the northern edge of the parchment. He mumbled something about troop movements, likely rehearsing battle plans in his head. 

Sera, ever the pragmatist, sighed and rubbed her temples. "Well, that was a pleasant way to wake up," she muttered, her tone laced with sarcasm. "Fancy a trip to the infirmary to mend broken bones and stitch up wounds, Liara? I'm sure the morning will be filled with delightful injuries thanks to your little scouting excursion." 




Liara and Sera step outside. "Will you be alright?" Liara looks Sera up and down, noting the black cirlces around her eyes and hunched shoulders.

Sera scoffed, straightening her shoulders with a forced air of confidence. "I'll be fine," she said, her voice a touch too sharp. "A few restless nights don't kill an elf. Besides, I'm practically immune to exhaustion thanks to all the potions I brew."

She paused, glancing at Liara with a skeptical eye. "You wouldn't happen to have a spare sleep potion tucked away in that bag of yours, would you?" she asked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Just in case my 'immune system' decides to fail me."
