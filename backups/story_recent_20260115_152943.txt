Liara entered the tent and said good morning to Marcus and Sera.

Marcus grunted in acknowledgment, not looking up from the map spread across his rough-hewn table. His brow was furrowed, tracing a finger along the northern edge of the parchment. He mumbled something about troop movements, likely rehearsing battle plans in his head. 

Sera, ever the pragmatist, sighed and rubbed her temples. "Well, that was a pleasant way to wake up," she muttered, her tone laced with sarcasm. "Fancy a trip to the infirmary to mend broken bones and stitch up wounds, Liara? I'm sure the morning will be filled with delightful injuries thanks to your little scouting excursion." 




Liara and Sera step outside. "Will you be alright?" Liara looks Sera up and down, noting the black cirlces around her eyes and hunched shoulders.
